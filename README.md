Hello, welcome to my personal blog where I document my various projects, most of them IT projects.
At the time of writing this (2022) I am a student in computer science specializing in cybersecurity.

I think that knowledge should be freely available to everyone, that's why all the content of this site is open source. So you can use, modify and redistribute my work.

if my work was useful to you consider to leave a message on my social network it would be a pleasure to know that I could help someone.
